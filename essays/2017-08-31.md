I've just started a Software Engineering course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
I've done bits of self learning here and there, but nothing at this level quite yet. 
I'm a little overwhelmed yet excited at the same time to embark on this journey.

My interest in coding in general was sparked when I spent a month in Mountain View with a close friend who
works for Google.  We spent a lot of time at the Google campus and I learned a lot about what at the time
to me seemed like an entirely different world.  Soon after I had a pop up on my Facebook about "Girls Learning to Code" and after clicking through I realized this was something I could actually leaarn to do. 

After several online bootcamps, I decided to actually enroll at UH to finish a Chemistry degree I had started many years ago. That quickly changed into a degree in computer science and here I am a year later, enrolled in Software Engineering at Manoa.

I know there is so much more I need to learn and I hope to be able to put all this together and become a creative developer in the future. I'm very excited to learn how to work with others in group projects as that is something I forsee needing to know in the future that I have yet to actually put into practice.

I'm quite intimidated by the software development course I'm currently taking at UH Manoa.  They said that passing while working full time was very difficult, and now I understand why.  A lot of time needs to be dedicated to learning this material, but I know the sacrifices I'll make to succeed in the class will be worth it in the end.
