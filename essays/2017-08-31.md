I've just started a Software Engineering course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
I've done bits of self learning here and there, but nothing at this level quite yet. 
I'm a little overwhelmed yet excited at the same time to embark on this journey.

My interest in coding in general was sparked when I spent a month in Mountain View with a close friend who
works for Google.  We spent a lot of time at the Google campus and I learned a lot about what at the time
to me seemed like an entirely different world.  Soon after I had a pop up on my Facebook about "Girls Learning to Code" and after clicking through I realized this was something I could actually leaarn to do. 

After several online bootcamps, I decided to actually enroll at UH to finish a Chemistry degree I had started many years ago. That quickly changed into a degree in computer science and here I am a year later, enrolled in Software Engineering at Manoa.
