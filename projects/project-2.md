summary: Self Taught JavaScript

Not so much a project, but what led me to my current path to become a software developer at UH Manoa
was a free, online coding camp that taught JavaScript.
I learned as much as I could, but after hitting a wall and not knowing how to really apply that knowledge, 
decided that finishing my BS degree in computer science was where I wanted to go next.
